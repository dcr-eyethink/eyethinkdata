\arguments{
\item{data}{data with one person per line, excluding rows with use=0}

\item{colour_condition}{colour split}

\item{x_condition}{x axis split (if not, specified colour condition used for x axis too)}

\item{facet_condition}{for faceting}

\item{dv}{name of single dv column, or multiple columns, in which case they will be split by x_condition unless colour or facet condition set to 'variable'}

\item{pid}{whats the name of col that identifies individuals}

\item{error_data}{data on error for mean, eg from Bayes analysis, to replace SE}

\item{cflip}{flip to horizontal plot}

\item{norm}{normalise / z-score values for comparison across scales}

\item{useall}{ignore the use column and plot all rows}

\item{conditions}{instead of passing individually, you can give a vector of up to 3}
