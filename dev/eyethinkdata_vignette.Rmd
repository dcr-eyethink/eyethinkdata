## eyethink data tools

This is a toolbox for behavioural data. It processes raw downloads from gorilla, preps behavioural datas for analysis and extracts and scores information from questionnaires. Performs basic plotting of RDIs (pirate plots), and correlations from raw data and ANOVAs and mixed models.

Here's how to get the latest version of the toolbox
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# devtools::install_github("dcr-eyethink/eyethinkdata")
library(eyethinkdata)
```


## Importing data from gorilla 

There are several functions all beginning with data_ that read in multiple data files and merge them into an R object. The most commonly used is data_collator_gorilla(). You pass it the name of a folder that contains downloads from gorilla. These downloads can be .zip files or unzipped folders that themselves contain gorilla .csv files. They look like this

![folders](datafolder.png)
To run the function, tell it the name of the folder that contains the downloaded items, or leave it blank and your OS will ask you to choose the folder.

```{r}
data <- data_collator_gorilla("gorilla_data")
```


Remember to give this function a folder that contains other folders that have the raw data in them. So now you have a list called data that contains several data.tables.

*data$data_task* contains all of the data from you gorilla tasks, the blue blobs in your experiment. This is the raw data from gorilla allcollated together, with a few other columns added. For example, *pid* is the participant identity (anonymised). *rt* is the reaction time column. 

```{r}
knitr::kable( head(data$data_task))
```
